# Cumulus AKM Proof of concept

This is an open respository for testing how the Active Knowledge Modelling (AKM) tool can be integrated with the OSDU community, open source software, and data definintions. The work is done as a collaboration between Equinor and Kavca. Kavca is developing as an open source tool for modelling data and workflows.

The OSDU platform is released under the Apache 2 software license. This site is used to store some of the OSDU data definitions for testing purposes.
